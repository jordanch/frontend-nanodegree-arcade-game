Once loaded, the game has begun. the objective is to get the player to the water which will score a point. If you get hit by one of the cockaroaches, you lose a point and will return to the starting area. Note that you need to remain on the water for 2s before being awarded a point. 

Controls:
-------------------------------

You can move your player with the UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys. Each keydown will move the player one block in that direction. In other words, once one of the movement keys is pressed, only then will the player move in that direction.
